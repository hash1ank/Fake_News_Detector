Fake News Detector using Deep Learning
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify news articles as real or fake. It includes data preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization), TF-IDF vectorization, and model training with evaluation on a held-out test set. The model achieves approximately 95% accuracy on unseen data.
